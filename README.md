# MP3-Visualizer
an mp3 visualizer and spotify mp3 downloader


# How to install and run

## Step 1 get client id and client secret
### 1.) Go to the Spotify [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).  Log in. Once at the Dashboard, click the green button labeled "Create App". Don't worry - you're not signing up for anything or commiting to something from Spotify. Here, **it really doesn't matter what you put** for "App name" and "App description". For me, I just put "Testing" for both. Make sure to check both agreement boxes and click "Create".
### 2.) You will see the "Client ID" field. Copy and save your Client ID to the client_id = section in your```config.ini```. Click "Show client secret" under Client ID and it should show you another long list of characters. Also copy and save your Client Secret to ```client_secret =``` in you ini file.


## Step 2 install Python
### You can install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Step 3 download pip requirements
### 1.) open up a file explorer and go to the files then right click and click open in terminal
### 2.) type ```pip install flask spotipy yt-dlp mutagen``` and hit enter
